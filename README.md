# Git Assignment - <heidihiahiahia>

a. An issue: a task, bug, or feature request that needs to be addressed within a project. It serves as a way to track and manage work items to discuss, assign, and prioritize tasks.

b. A pull request is a proposed change to a repository. It enables developers to notify others about the changes they've made and ask for feedback, review, and approval before merging those changes into the main codebase.

c. To open a pull request:

Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
Switch to the branch containing the changes you want to merge.
Click on the "Pull requests" tab.
Click the "New pull request" button.
Choose the branches you want to compare.
Review the changes, add a title and description to the pull request.
Click the "Create pull request" button.

d.How to add someone to your repository:
Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
Click on the "Settings" tab.
In the left sidebar, click on "Manage access."
Click on the green "Invite a collaborator" button.
Enter the GitHub username, email address, or full name of the person you want to add.
Select the appropriate permission level (e.g., read, write, admin).
Click the "Add [username]" button.

e. Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in source code during software development. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. While Git is the tool used for version control, GitHub provides additional features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and collaboration tools.

f. The git diff command is used to show the differences between two states of a repository. It can be used to compare changes between commits, branches, or between the working directory and the staging area.

g. The main branch, often named master or main, is the primary branch in a Git repository. It typically represents the stable version of the project and serves as the baseline from which all other branches are derived. In some contexts, it's also referred to as the default branch.

h. It's generally not recommended to push changes directly into the main branch, especially in collaborative environments. Instead, it's best practice to create a new branch for each feature, bug fix, or task, make changes on that branch, and then open a pull request to propose those changes for review and merging into the main branch. This approach allows for better organization, collaboration, and code review before integrating changes into the main codebase.
